## What are Teams?

Teams are the top-level organizational structure in Strettch Cloud. Every resource you create—compute instances, DNS zones, and more—belongs to a team.

When you create your first account, Strettch Cloud automatically creates a default team for you, named after your first name (for example, "Liberi's Team" if your name is Liberi). You can create additional teams or join existing ones to collaborate with other users.

## How Teams Organize Resources

All cloud resources belong directly to teams—there is no intermediate project or organization layer. All team members with appropriate permissions can access and manage these resources.

### Key Principles

- **Isolated Resources**: Teams cannot share resources or billing. A compute instance in "Team A" cannot be transferred to "Team B."
- **Multi-Team Membership**: You can belong to multiple teams simultaneously, each with independent resources and billing.
- **Separate Billing**: Each team has its own billing account. Usage and charges are tracked separately per team.

## Team Roles and Permissions

Teams use a role-based access control system with three levels:

| Permission | Owner | Admin | Member |
|------------|-------|-------|--------|
| **Resource Management** |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Manage compute instances | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Manage DNS zones | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Configure webhooks | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;View resources | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| **Team Management** |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Invite users | ✓ | ✓ | ⛔ |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remove Members | ✓ | ✓ | ⛔ |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remove Admins | ✓ | ⛔ | ⛔ |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Change roles | ✓ | ✓ | ⛔ |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Update team settings | ✓ | ✓ | ⛔ |
| **Billing & Finance** |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;View billing info | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Update payment methods | ✓ | ✓ | ⛔ |
| **Critical Actions** |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Delete team | ✓ | ⛔ | ⛔ |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transfer ownership | ✓ | ⛔ | ⛔ |

<Warning>
**Violation Policy**

If any team member uses a team resource to commit a violation (for example, illegal activity on a compute instance), all resources belonging to that team will be shut down immediately pending investigation. This may result in a permanent ban.
</Warning>

### Switching Between Teams

Use the team selector in the dashboard to switch between teams. Resources and billing information change based on the currently selected team.
