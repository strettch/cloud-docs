## What are Teams?

Teams are the top-level organizational structure in Strettch Cloud. Every resource you create—compute instances, DNS zones, and more—belongs to a team.

When you create your first account, Strettch Cloud automatically creates a default team for you, named after your first name (for example, "Liberi's Team" if your name is Liberi). You can create additional teams or join existing ones to collaborate with other users.

## How Teams Organize Resources

All cloud resources in Strettch Cloud belong directly to teams. There is no intermediate project or organization layer.

**Team Structure Example**:

<Frame>
  <img className="block dark:hidden" src="/images/computes/team-architecture.png" style={{ borderRadius: '0.2rem' }} />
  <img className="hidden dark:block" src="/images/computes/team-architecture-dark.png" style={{ borderRadius: '0.2rem' }} />
</Frame>

### Key Principles

- **Resources belong directly to teams**: There is no intermediate project layer. When you create a compute instance or DNS zone, it belongs to the team. All team members with appropriate permissions can access and manage these resources.
- **Users can join multiple teams**: You can be a member of several teams simultaneously, each with its own resources and billing.
- **Teams have roles**: Teams include roles (owner, admin, member) to control who can manage resources. See the sections below for details on permissions.
- **Teams are isolated**: Teams cannot share resources or billing with each other. Each team operates independently.

## Team Roles and Permissions

Teams use a role-based access control system with three levels of access:

| Role | Permissions | Who Should Have This Role |
|------|-------------|---------------------------|
| **Owner** | Full control including team deletion and ownership transfer | Team creator or designated owner |
| **Admin** | Manage resources, invite/remove users, update payment methods | Trusted team administrators |
| **Member** | Manage emails, domains, and webhooks | Developers and contributors |

### Permission Details

| Permission | Member | Admin | Owner |
|------------|:------:|:-----:|:-----:|
| Add domain name | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Add DNS record | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| View team resources | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Access billing information | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
|  |  |  |  |
| Invite new users to the team | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Remove Members & Admin from the team | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Change Member roles | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Manage team settings (name, avatar) | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Create and manage compute instances | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
|  |  |  |  |
| Delete the team | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Transfer team ownership | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |

<Warning>
**Violation Policy**

If any team member uses a team resource to commit a violation (for example, illegal activity on a compute instance), all resources belonging to that team will be shut down immediately pending investigation. This may result in a permanent ban.
</Warning>

## Team Collaboration

### How Collaboration Works

Team members with appropriate permissions can work together on shared resources. When one member creates a compute instance, all team members can see it in the dashboard and manage it according to their role permissions.

### Switching Between Teams

If you belong to multiple teams, you can switch between them using the team selector in the dashboard. Resources and billing information change based on the currently selected team.
