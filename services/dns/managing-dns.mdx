## Registering a Domain

Before you can manage DNS records, you need to register a domain with Strettch Cloud DNS.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Domains">
    Go to your team's dashboard and select the **Domains** tab.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Register Domain">
    Click **Register Domain**. Enter the domain address you want to register (e.g., `example.com`).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Validate Domain">
    Click **Confirm** to validate the domain availability.

    - If the domain name is invalid or unavailable, you'll see a notification. Choose a different domain name.
    - If the domain is valid, you'll move to the nameserver configuration step.

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Adding Nameservers to Your Domain Provider

After validating your domain, configure your domain provider to use Strettch Cloud's nameservers.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Copy Nameservers">
    In the domain setup wizard, you'll see a table with Strettch Cloud nameservers. Click the **copy icons** to copy each nameserver:
    - `ns1.strettch.com`
    - `ns2.strettch.com`

    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/domains/add-nameservers.png" style={{ borderRadius: "0.2rem" }} />
    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Update Domain Provider">
    Log in to your domain registrar (where you purchased the domain). Navigate to your domain's DNS or nameserver settings. Replace the existing nameservers with the Strettch Cloud nameservers you copied.

    The exact steps vary by registrar. Common registrars include GoDaddy, Namecheap, and Cloudflare.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Activate Domain">
    Return to the Strettch Cloud domain setup wizard. Scroll down and click the **Activate domain** button to complete the registration.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  You must add Strettch Cloud's nameservers to your domain provider. Without this step, your domain will remain inactive and DNS records will not work.
</Warning>

## Verifying Domain Status

After activating your domain, check its status to ensure proper configuration.

<Steps>
  <Step title="View Domain List">
    After domain creation, you'll be redirected to the domains list for your team. Each domain shows its current status.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Understand Status Indicators">
    Domain activation can take between **3 minutes** and **24 hours** depending on your domain provider's propagation speed.

    - **Activating**: Domain is waiting for nameserver propagation to complete
    - **Active**: Domain is fully operational and DNS records are working
    - **Inactive**: Domain failed to activate (nameservers not configured correctly)

    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/domains/verify-domain-status.png" style={{ borderRadius: '0.2rem' }} />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  If a domain remains inactive beyond 24 hours, verify with your domain registrar that Strettch Cloud's nameservers (`ns1.strettch.com` and `ns2.strettch.com`) are correctly configured.
</Warning>

## Managing DNS Records

Once your domain is active and using Strettch Cloud's nameservers, you can manage its DNS records.

<Warning>
  Your domain must use **Strettch Cloud's nameservers** for DNS records to work. If you're using a third-party domain registrar, ensure you've added our nameservers as described above.
</Warning>

### Supported Record Types

Strettch Cloud DNS supports the following record types:

| Record Type | Hostname Example | Description |
| ----------- | ---------------- | ----------- |
| **A** | `example.com` | Redirects to IPv4 address `192.0.2.1` |
| **AAAA** | `example.com` | Redirects to IPv6 address `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:733` |
| **SRV** | `_sip._tcp.example.com` | Service located at `10 60 5060 sip.example.com` |
| **TXT** | `_dmarc.example.com` | Returns `v=DMARC1; p=none; rua=mailto:dmarc@example.com` |
| **MX** | `example.com` | Mail handled by `mail.example.com` |
| **CNAME** | `blog.example.com` | Is an alias of `wiki.example.com` |

### Adding DNS Records

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select Domain">
    On your team's dashboard, go to the **Domains** tab. Click on the domain you want to manage to open its Advanced Settings page.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create Record">
    On the Advanced Settings page, click **Add new record**. Fill out the DNS Record form with the following information:

    **Name**: The prefix or subdomain for the record. For `www.example.com`, enter `www`. For the root domain, leave blank or use `@`.

    **Type**: Select the record type (`A`, `AAAA`, `CNAME`, `MX`, `TXT`, `SRV`, or `NS`).

    **Value**: The target value for the record (IP address, domain name, or text content).

    **TTL**: Time to live in seconds. Default is 60 seconds. Lower values mean faster propagation but more DNS queries.

    **Comment** (optional): Add a note explaining what this record is for.

    **Additional Fields**: Some records require extra data. For example, MX records need a priority value.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Save Record">
    Click **Create Record** to add the DNS record. Changes take effect immediately.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Verifying DNS Records

After adding or modifying DNS records, verify they're configured correctly.

**Using Third-Party Tools**

Use online tools to check DNS propagation globally:
- [DNS Checker](https://dnschecker.org)
- [DNS Map](https://dnsmap.io)

These tools show how your DNS records appear in different regions worldwide.

**Using Command Line**

Check DNS records directly using the `dig` command:

<CodeGroup>
```bash Check A record
dig A api.example.com +short
```

```bash Check MX record
dig MX example.com +short
```

```bash Check TXT record
dig TXT _dmarc.example.com +short
```

```bash Check CNAME record
dig CNAME blog.example.com +short
```
</CodeGroup>

The `+short` flag returns only the record value without additional information.

### Removing DNS Records

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Domain">
    On your team's dashboard, select the **Domains** tab. Click on the domain containing the record you want to delete.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Delete Record">
    On the Advanced Settings page, locate the record you want to remove. Click the ellipsis menu **(â‹¯)** next to the record and select **Delete**.

    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/domains/delete-dns.png" style={{ borderRadius: "0.2rem" }} />
    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Confirm Deletion">
    Follow the prompts to confirm deletion. The record will be removed immediately.
  </Step>
</Steps>
