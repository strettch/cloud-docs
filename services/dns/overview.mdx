## What is Strettch Cloud DNS?

Strettch Cloud DNS is a managed DNS service that lets you host and manage DNS records for your domains. It provides enterprise-grade performance with fast propagation across the global network.

When you use Strettch Cloud DNS, you point your domain to our nameservers (`ns1.strettch.com` and `ns2.strettch.com`). From that point, you manage all DNS records directly through the Strettch Cloud dashboard.

## Understanding DNS Basics

### What are Nameservers?

Nameservers are servers that store DNS records and respond to DNS queries. They tell the internet where to find your website, email servers, and other services.

When you use Strettch Cloud DNS, you configure your domain registrar to use our nameservers:
- `ns1.strettch.com`
- `ns2.strettch.com`

### What are DNS Records?

DNS records are instructions that map domain names to IP addresses or other values. Each record type serves a specific purpose:

| Record Type | Purpose | Example |
| ----------- | ------- | ------- |
| **A** | Maps domain to IPv4 address | `example.com` → `192.0.2.1` |
| **AAAA** | Maps domain to IPv6 address | `example.com` → `2001:0db8:85a3::8a2e:0370:7334` |
| **CNAME** | Creates alias from one domain to another | `blog.example.com` → `example.com` |
| **MX** | Specifies mail servers for domain | `example.com` → `mail.example.com` |
| **TXT** | Stores text information (verification, SPF, DKIM) | Domain verification strings, email policies |
| **SRV** | Defines location of services | SIP, XMPP, and other service endpoints |
| **NS** | Delegates subdomain to other nameservers | `api.example.com` → external DNS provider |

### What is DNS Propagation?

DNS propagation is the time it takes for DNS changes to update across all DNS servers on the internet. Traditional DNS changes can take 24-48 hours to propagate globally.

With Strettch Cloud DNS, changes are fast on our nameservers. However, clients may still cache old records based on the TTL (Time To Live) value you set.

### What is TTL?

TTL (Time To Live) is the duration in seconds that DNS records are cached by DNS resolvers. A lower TTL means changes propagate faster but increases DNS queries. A higher TTL reduces queries but delays change propagation.

Default TTL on Strettch Cloud DNS is 60 seconds, which balances performance with flexibility for updates.
