Before deploying your first resources on Strettch Cloud, understanding these core concepts will help you organize your infrastructure and manage costs effectively.

## Understanding Teams

**Problem**: How do I organize my cloud resources and collaborate with others?

Teams are the top-level organizational structure in Strettch Cloud. Every resource you create—compute instances, DNS zones, and more—belongs to a team.

### How Teams Work

When you create your first account, Strettch Cloud automatically creates a default team for you, named after your first name (for example, "Liberi's Team" if your name is Liberi). You can create additional teams or join existing ones to collaborate with other users.

**Team Structure with Multiple Teams**:
```
        ┌──────────────────────┐         ┌──────────────────────┐
        │  Liberi's Team       │         │  Acme Corp Team      │
        ├──────────────────────┤         ├──────────────────────┤
        │ Resources:           │         │ Resources:           │
        │  • Compute-001       │         │  • Compute-100       │
        │  • Compute-002       │         │  • Compute-101       │
        │  • DNS: example.com  │         │  • DNS: acme.io      │
        └──────────────────────┘         └──────────────────────┘
                 ↑                                ↑
                 │                                │
                 └────────────┬───────────────────┘
                              │
                         User (Liberi)
                      Member of both teams

    ✓ Each team has isolated resources (no sharing)
    ✓ Users can belong to multiple teams
    ✓ Each team has separate billing
```

### Key Team Principles

- **Resources belong directly to teams**: There is no intermediate project layer. When you create a compute instance or DNS zone, it belongs to the team.
- **Users can join multiple teams**: You can be a member of several teams simultaneously, each with its own resources and billing.
- **Teams have roles**: Teams include roles like owner and member to control who can manage resources. See the Teams documentation for details on permissions.
- **Teams are isolated**: Teams cannot share resources or billing with each other. Each team operates independently.

<Warning>
**Violation Policy**

If any team member uses a team resource to commit a violation (for example, illegal activity on a compute instance), all resources belonging to that team will be shut down immediately pending investigation. This may result in a permanent ban.
</Warning>

## How Billing Works

**Problem**: When am I charged for my cloud resources?

Strettch Cloud uses a **pay-as-you-go** billing model not pay-per-use. Understanding how this works helps you predict and control costs.

| Billing Model | How It Works | Used by Us? |
|---------------|--------------|-------------|
| **Pay-as-you-go** | You are billed for how long you reserve resources, regardless of actual usage. A compute instance reserved for 24 hours costs the same whether you use it heavily or leave it idle. | ✓ Yes |
| **Pay-per-use** | You are billed based on actual resource consumption with auto-scaling. If a 1 CPU / 2GB instance scales to 2 CPU / 4GB, you are billed for the increased specs. | ✗ No |

<Tip>
**Billing Example**

A compute instance costs **10 RWF per hour**. If you reserve this instance for 24 hours:
```
10 RWF/hour × 24 hours = 240 RWF total
```

You pay 240 RWF regardless of whether the instance processes workloads all day or sits idle.
</Tip>

<Warning>
Stopping a compute instance does not stop billing. To stop incurring charges, you must destroy the resource. See "Resource Lifecycle" below for details on resource states.
</Warning>

## Resource Lifecycle

**Problem**: What states can my resources be in, and what do they mean for access and billing?

Different resource types may have different lifecycles. This section focuses primarily on **compute instances** as the most common example.

### Lifecycle States

Here's the typical flow through lifecycle states:
```
Creating → Running ⟷ Stopped → Destroying → Destroyed
```

| State | Description | Web Dashboard | Resource Access (SSH/Console) | Billable? | Can Transition To |
|-------|-------------|---------------|-------------------------------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Creating** | Initial provisioning when first created | Visible | Not accessible | No* | Running |
| **Running** | Normal operational state | Visible | Fully accessible | **Yes** | Stopped, Destroying |
| **Stopped** | Instance stopped but resources reserved | Visible | Not accessible | **Yes** | Starting, Destroying |
| **Starting/Rebooting** | Transitioning from Stopped or rebooting | Visible | Not accessible | **Yes** | Running |
| **Destroying** | Brief destruction process (seconds) | Visible | Not accessible | No* | Destroyed |
| **Destroyed** | Final state - all data permanently deleted | Not visible | Not accessible | **No** | None (irreversible) |

<Info>
*Creating and Destroying states are not billable due to their very brief duration (typically less than 1 minute).
</Info>

<Warning>
The **Stopped** state still incurs charges because resources remain reserved. To stop billing, you must **Destroy** the resource.
</Warning>

### Lifecycle for Other Resources

DNS zones and other resources may have different lifecycle states. Refer to the specific resource documentation for details.
