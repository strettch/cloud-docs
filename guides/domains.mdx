## Verify you domain Status 

 After creating your domain you will be redirected to the listing of all domains specific to that team. where you can easily identify the statuses of the domains created: 
    * after a domain is created it may take **3 min** to **24 hours** to activate it and when the domain is activating you will se the status **activating**
    * A domain that is active and thus operation will have an active status and success flag.
    * A domain that goes beyond 24 hours whilst still being not active will be considered as inactive.

    <Warning>If a domain goes beyond 24 hours and still not active, we recommend to check your DNS provider and check if you domain has our nameservers configured on it. </Warning>

## Managing DNS records 

    Once a domain has been added and is using Strettch cloud's nameservers, you can view its DNS records from the **Domains** page. From there, you can view, add, verify, remove the records, or add presets.

     <Warning>To make sure DNS records are applied, and to allow you to manage them, your domain needs to use **Strettch Cloud's nameservers** . If you are using a third-party domain, you will be provided with the Strettch CLoud's nameservers to copy and use with your registrar.</Warning>
    Here's a list of record types we support: 
   
| Record Type     | Hostname (example) | Description |
| ------------- | --------------- | -----------------|
| **A**         | example.com   | redirects to 192.0.2.1|
| **AAAA**  | example.com   | redirects to 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:733|
| **SRV**   | -sip._tcp.example.com  | service located at 10 60 5060 sip.example.com |
| **TXT**         | _dmarc.example.com  | returns v=DMARC1; p=none; rua=mailto:dmarc@example.com |
| **MX**     | example.com   | mail handled by mail.example.com |
| **CNAME** | blog.example.com | is an alias of wiki.example.com|

Now let's go straight to adding our DNS records.

 <AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Selecting your domain" icon="1" iconType="solid">
    On your team's **dashboard**, select the Domains tab. From the Domains page, click on a domain of your choice to view its Advanced Settings page.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Add DNS Record" icon="2" iconType="solid">
    Once on the Advanced Settings page of your domain, select the **Add new record** button to fill out the DNS Record form. Once complete, click on the **Create Record** button.
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/domains/new-record.png" style={{ borderRadius: "0.2rem" }} />
    </Frame>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

You can then create a new DNS record with the following data:

* **Name:** The prefix or location of the record. For **www.example.com**, the name argument would be **www**.

* **Type:** Types can be `A`, `AAAA`, `CAA`, `CNAME`, `MX`, `NS`, `SRV`, or `TXT`.

* **Value:** The value of the record.

* **TTL:** Default is 60 seconds. For advanced users, this value can be customized.

* **Comment:** An optional comment to provide context on what this record is for.

* **More:** Some records will require more data. MX records, for example, will request "priority".

## Verifying DNS Records

Once DNS records have been changed, you may wish to check that these have been set correctly. There are many third-party tools that do this, such as DNS Checker and DNS Map - these show the state of your DNS records in different regions of the world.

You can also use the dig command to check the DNS record for your domain:

<CodeGroup>
```bash A records example on Windows, MacOs, Linux
$ dig A api.example.com +short
```

```bash Mx example on Windows, MacOs, Linux
$ dig MX example.com +short
```
</CodeGroup>


## Removing DNS Records

To remove DNS records:

* On your team's **dashboard**, select the **Domains** tab. From the Domains page, click on a domain of your choice to view its Advanced Settings page.
* Select the ellipsis (â‹¯) to access the context menu and select **Delete**. Follow the prompts to delete the record.
