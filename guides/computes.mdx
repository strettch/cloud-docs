  <Accordion title="Create Compute" icon="rocket" iconType="solid">

Navigate to the **Computes** tab and click **New Compute**. You'll need to configure the following:

### 1. Choose Location

Select a hosting location for your server. This affects network speed and latency for optimal performance.

### 2. Choose Image

Select an operating system image for your compute.

  <img src="/images/computes/choose-image.png" style={{ borderRadius: "0.2rem" }} />
</Frame>

### 3. Choose Type

Select your compute configuration: `shared` or `dedicated` CPU.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/computes/choose-type.png" style={{ borderRadius: "0.2rem" }} />
</Frame>

After choosing the type, specify your compute specs: **CPU**, **RAM**, **Storage**. Pricing is displayed alongside each configuration.

### 4. Set Root Password

Create a secure password for root user access.

<Warning>
Store your password securely. You will not receive an email with your compute details or password.
</Warning>

### 5. Compute Name & Tags

- **Compute Name:** Give your compute an identifiable name
- **Add Tags (Optional):** Organize and manage your computes with custom tags

### 6. Create

Review your configuration and pricing, then click **Create Compute**. You need sufficient credits to create the compute.

<Frame>

</Frame>

<Note>
Your compute cost depends on the specs you selected. The price is shown during configuration.
</Note>

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Access Compute" icon="terminal" iconType="solid">

### Web Console

Access your compute through a browser-based console. The [SC Agent](/agents/sc-agent) is automatically installed and ready within **5 minutes** of compute creation.

To open the console:
1. Click your compute name
2. Click **Console** in the left menu

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/computes/open-console.png" style={{ borderRadius: '0.2rem' }} />
</Frame>

### SSH Access

Connect directly via SSH from your terminal:

<CodeGroup>
```bash SSH connection
ssh root@your-public-ip -p 222
```
</CodeGroup>

Replace `your-public-ip` with your compute's IP address (found on the compute details page).

**Example:**

<CodeGroup>
```bash Example
ssh root@192.0.2.1 -p 222
```
</CodeGroup>

<Note>
**Port 222:** Required for most internet providers. MTN network users can connect without specifying the port (default port 22).
</Note>

<Warning>
Have your root password ready. If forgotten, reset it using console access.
</Warning>

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Monitoring" icon="chart-line" iconType="solid">

Click on your compute name in the **Computes** tab to access detailed monitoring and management.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/computes/compute-overview.png" style={{ borderRadius: '0.2rem' }} />
</Frame>

### Available Metrics

Your compute includes five real-time performance graphs:

- **Memory** - Memory usage over time
- **CPU Usage** - Processing power utilization (user jobs and system processes)
- **Disk I/O** - Read and write operations in MB/s
- **Network** - Inbound and outbound traffic (packets)
- **Load** - Server resource load in MBs

View graphs for: 1 hour, 6 hours, 24 hours, 7 days, 30 days, or 90 days. Hover over any graph to see metrics at specific points in time.

### SC Metrics Agent

The [SC Metrics Agent](/agents/sc-metrics-agent) automatically installs with your compute to collect performance data. Without it, monitoring graphs will be empty.

<Warning>
If you uninstall the SC Metrics Agent, monitoring data collection will stop and graphs will be unavailable.
</Warning>

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Compute Management" icon="sliders" iconType="solid">

### Turn ON/OFF

To power your compute on or off:
1. Click your compute name from the dashboard
2. Click the switch button next to the Console button

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/computes/turn-on-off.png" style={{ borderRadius: '0.2rem' }} />
</Frame>

When powering off, we attempt a graceful shutdown first. If that fails, we force shutdown, which may corrupt data. For data integrity, shut down from the command line:

<CodeGroup>
```bash Graceful shutdown
poweroff
```
</CodeGroup>

<Warning>
**Billing continues for powered-off computes.** To stop billing, destroy the compute instead.
</Warning>
