## Creating Your First Compute Instance

**Problem**: How do I provision a new server with the right specifications for my application?

**Why it matters**: Choosing the correct configuration upfront prevents performance issues and unnecessary costs later.

Navigate to the **Computes** tab and click **New Compute** to begin. You'll configure your instance through six steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Choose Location">
    Select a hosting location for your server.

    The location you choose affects network latency and performance for your users. Select a location closest to where your primary traffic originates.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose Image">
    Select an operating system image for your compute.

    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/computes/choose-image.png" style={{ borderRadius: "0.2rem" }} />
    </Frame>

    Available images include popular Linux distributions. Choose based on your application requirements and team familiarity.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose Type and Specifications">
    Select your compute configuration: `shared` or `dedicated` CPU.

    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/computes/choose-type.png" style={{ borderRadius: "0.2rem" }} />
    </Frame>

    **Shared CPU**: Cost-effective for applications with variable load patterns

    **Dedicated CPU**: Consistent performance for production workloads

    After choosing the type, specify your compute specs: **CPU**, **RAM**, **Storage**. Pricing is displayed alongside each configuration so you can see costs in real-time.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set Root Password">
    Create a secure password for root user access.

    <Warning>
    Store your password securely using a password manager. You will not receive an email with your compute details or password. If you lose this password, you'll need to reset it through console access.
    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Name and Tags">
    **Compute Name**: Give your compute an identifiable name that describes its purpose (e.g., "api-production", "staging-web-server")

    **Add Tags (Optional)**: Organize and manage your computes with custom tags. Useful for filtering, cost allocation, or automation.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review and Create">
    Review your configuration and pricing, then click **Create Compute**.

    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/computes/create-compute.png" style={{ borderRadius: "0.2rem" }} />
    </Frame>

    <Note>
    Your compute cost depends on the specs you selected. The price is shown during configuration. Ensure you have sufficient credits in your account to create the compute.
    </Note>

    Your compute will be provisioned within seconds. Once in the **Running** state, you can connect and start using it.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Connecting to Your Compute Instance

**Problem**: How do I access my compute instance to install applications and manage services?

### Using the Web Console

Access your compute through a browser-based console without needing any SSH client software.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Console">
    Click your compute name from the dashboard, then click **Console** in the left menu.

    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/computes/open-console.png" style={{ borderRadius: '0.2rem' }} />
    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Wait for SC Agent Installation">
    The [SC Agent](/agents/sc-agent) is automatically installed on your compute. It will be ready within **less than 3 minutes** of compute creation.

    The SC Agent enables browser-based console access. You can start using the console as soon as the agent installation completes.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Access Your Terminal">
    Once the console loads, you'll have a full terminal interface to your compute. Enter your root password to log in.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Using SSH Access

Connect directly via SSH from your local terminal for a native command-line experience.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Find Your Compute IP Address">
    Locate your compute's public IP address on the compute details page in the dashboard.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Connect via SSH">
    Open your terminal and connect using this command:

    ```bash SSH connection
    ssh root@your-public-ip -p 222
    ```

    Replace `your-public-ip` with your actual compute IP address.

    **Example:**
    ```bash Example
    ssh root@192.0.2.1 -p 222
    ```

    <Note>
    **Port 222**: Required for most internet providers. MTN network users can connect without specifying the port (default port 22).
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter Your Password">
    When prompted, enter the root password you created during compute setup.

    <Warning>
    If you've forgotten your root password, reset it using console access through the web dashboard.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Understanding Networking

**Problem**: How do I make my compute instance accessible from the internet, and when should I use public vs private networking?

**Why it matters**: Proper network architecture significantly improves security by limiting attack surface and helps reduce costs by only paying for public IPs where needed.

### Public IP Addresses (Optional)

By default, compute instances are **not** assigned a public IP address. They remain in a private network, inaccessible from the internet but able to communicate with other instances in your team.

#### When You Need a Public IP

You need a public IP address when your instance must:
- **Receive incoming connections** from the internet (web servers, APIs, public-facing services)
- **Be accessed via SSH** directly from your local machine
- **Serve as an entry point** to your infrastructure (reverse proxies, load balancers)

#### Cost

Public IP addresses cost **1,000 RWF** and are billed separately from compute resources.

#### How to Attach a Public IP

When creating a compute instance, you'll see an option to attach a public IP:

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/computes/attach-public-ip.png" style={{ borderRadius: "0.2rem" }} />
</Frame>

Simply check the box to attach a public IP to your instance.

### Private Network Architecture (Recommended for Security)

**Problem**: How can I improve security while running multiple services?

**Best practice**: Use a single public-facing instance as a gateway, keeping your application servers private.

#### Example Architecture

Imagine you're running a web application with these components:

```
                    PUBLIC INTERNET
                          ↑
                          │ Public IP (1,000 RWF)

Legend:
• All VMs are in the private network
• Reverse Proxy: Has a public IP, accessible from internet
• Frontend, Backend, Database: No public IP, only accessible within private network
• Database: Only communicates with Backend VM
```

**Benefits of this approach:**
1. **Enhanced Security** - Only one VM is exposed to the internet, reducing attack surface
2. **Cost Savings** - Pay for only one public IP (1,000 RWF) instead of four (4,000 RWF)
3. **Centralized Public Security** - Configure internet-facing firewalls, SSL certificates, and security rules in one place
4. **Simplified Management** - Update public security measures on one VM instead of multiple

## Monitoring Performance and Health

**Problem**: How do I know if my compute instance is performing well or experiencing issues?

**Why it matters**: Proactive monitoring helps you identify performance bottlenecks, plan capacity upgrades, and troubleshoot issues before they impact users.

Click on your compute name in the **Computes** tab to access detailed monitoring and management.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/computes/compute-overview.png" style={{ borderRadius: '0.2rem' }} />
</Frame>

### Available Metrics

Your compute includes five real-time performance graphs that help you understand resource utilization:

| Metric | What It Shows | What to Watch For |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Memory** | Memory usage over time | Consistently high usage (>90%) indicates you need more RAM |
| **CPU Usage** | Processing power utilization (user jobs and system processes) | Sustained high CPU (>80%) suggests you need more CPU cores |
| **Disk I/O** | Read and write operations in MB/s | High I/O wait times can slow down applications |
| **Network** | Inbound and outbound traffic (packets) | Unexpected spikes may indicate traffic anomalies |
| **Load** | Server resource load in MBs | Load higher than CPU count suggests resource contention |

### Time Range Options

View graphs for different time periods to understand short-term issues or long-term trends:

- **1 hour** - Real-time troubleshooting
- **6 hours** - Recent performance patterns
- **24 hours** - Daily usage cycles
- **7 days** - Weekly trends
- **30 days** - Monthly patterns and capacity planning

Hover over any graph to see exact metrics at specific points in time.

### SC Metrics Agent

The [SC Metrics Agent](/agents/sc-metrics-agent) automatically installs with your compute to collect performance data. This agent runs in the background and sends metrics to the dashboard for visualization.

<Warning>
If you uninstall the SC Metrics Agent, monitoring data collection will stop and graphs will be unavailable. Only remove this agent if you're using alternative monitoring solutions.
</Warning>

## Managing Compute Power States

**Problem**: How do I control when my compute instance is running or stopped?

### Turning Your Compute ON or OFF

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Compute Details">
    Click your compute name from the dashboard.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Use the Power Switch">
    Click the switch button next to the Console button.

    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/computes/turn-on-off.png" style={{ borderRadius: '0.2rem' }} />
    </Frame>

    The system will attempt a graceful shutdown first. If that fails, it will force shutdown.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Graceful Shutdown from Command Line

For maximum data integrity, shut down from within your compute instance:

```bash Graceful shutdown
poweroff
```

This ensures all running processes close properly and data is written to disk before shutdown.

<Warning>
**Billing continues for powered-off computes.** Stopped instances still reserve resources (CPU, RAM, storage) and incur charges at the same rate. To stop billing completely, you must destroy the compute instance.
</Warning>

## Best Practices

**Problem**: How do I ensure my compute instances are secure, performant, and cost-effective?

**Why it matters**: Following best practices prevents security breaches, performance issues, and unexpected costs.

### Security

**Use SSH Keys Instead of Passwords**
- SSH keys are more secure than password authentication
- Generate a key pair locally and add your public key to `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`
- Disable password authentication in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`

**Keep Your System Updated**
- Regularly update your operating system and packages
- Run `apt update && apt upgrade` (Ubuntu/Debian) or equivalent for your OS
- Subscribe to security mailing lists for your distribution

**Configure a Firewall**
- Use `ufw` (Uncomplicated Firewall) or `iptables` to restrict access
- Only open ports that your applications actually need
- Consider using port 222 for SSH (as configured) to avoid automated scanners

**Limit Root Access**
- Create a non-root user for daily operations
- Use `sudo` for administrative tasks
- Only use root when absolutely necessary

### Performance

**Monitor Resource Usage**
- Check your monitoring graphs regularly
- Set up alerts for sustained high CPU or memory usage
- Plan upgrades before hitting resource limits

**Choose the Right Instance Type**
- Use shared CPU for development and staging
- Use dedicated CPU for production workloads
- Start small and scale up based on actual usage

**Optimize Application Performance**
- Profile your applications to find bottlenecks
- Use caching where appropriate (Redis, Memcached)
- Optimize database queries and indexes

### Cost Management

**Right-Size Your Instances**
- Don't over-provision resources "just in case"
- Review metrics after a few weeks and adjust specifications
- Scale up only when metrics consistently show resource constraints

**Destroy Unused Instances**
- Delete development or testing instances when not in use
- Remember: stopped instances still incur charges
- Use tags to identify instances that can be safely destroyed

**Plan for Growth**
- Monitor usage trends over 30-90 days
- Anticipate capacity needs before hitting limits
- Consider reserved instances for long-running workloads (if available)
