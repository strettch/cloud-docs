## Building Internet Applications in Africa

If you are building digital products in Africa, you face challenges that developers in other regions rarely encounter. Your application might feel slow despite being well-optimized. Your cloud bills might change unpredictably due to currency fluctuations. Compliance with local data protection laws might require working with unreliable providers.

Strettch Cloud addresses these challenges.

## What Strettch Cloud Provides

Strettch Cloud is an Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) platform that provides cloud computing across Africa. We offer compute instances, DNS management, and networkingâ€”similar to AWS or DigitalOceanâ€”but with infrastructure located in African countries.

All backed by local hosting, local currency billing, and local support.

<Note>
The name "Strettch" (pronounced /stretÊ§/, like "stretch") represents our core belief: there's always more on the other side of "good enough." The double 'tt' is intentionalâ€”it emphasizes that extra push, the additional effort most stop short of. When you think you've done enough, stretching just a bit more often reveals what separates the exceptional from the average. Strettch Cloud is a product of [strettch.com](https://strettch.com/), built on this philosophy of continuous improvement.

## Problems Strettch Cloud Solves

African businesses have two main options for cloud infrastructure: global providers like AWS and Google Cloud, or local providers. Both options create significant problems.

Global providers offer reliable infrastructure but introduce high latency and currency risk. Local providers eliminate latency but often deliver unreliable service at premium prices.

### Reducing Latency for Better User Experience

High latency makes applications feel slow and frustrates users. The closest AWS region to many African countries is in Cape Town, South Africa. From Rwanda, this creates around 110ms of delay on every request, with latency sometimes peaking to 200ms during network congestion.

```bash
# Ping from Rwanda to AWS Cape Town (the closest AWS region)
root@docs-compute:~# ping -c 5 13.247.110.111
PING 13.247.110.111 (13.247.110.111) 56(84) bytes of data.

rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 110.341/110.479/110.578/0.079 ms
```

Modern applications make hundreds of requests per page load. At 110ms per request (and higher during peak times), these delays compound into a noticeably slow user experience. Countries like Rwanda, Ghana, and Kenya have no nearby cloud infrastructure.

**Our Solution:**
Strettch Cloud operates infrastructure in African countries, starting with Rwanda. This reduces latency to 10-30ms. Your users get the responsive experience they expect.

### Eliminating Currency Risk from Cloud Bills

Running a business in local currency while paying cloud bills in USD creates financial uncertainty. Currency fluctuations directly impact your operating costs.

In Rwanda, the exchange rate moved from 1,200 RWF per USD to 1,500 RWF per USD. A business with a $20,000 annual cloud bill saw costs increase from 24 million RWF to 30 million RWF. This is a 6 million RWF increase with no change in usage.

**Our Solution:**
Strettch Cloud bills in local currency. In Rwanda, you pay in Rwandan Francs (RWF). You can use local payment methods including mobile money. Your budget stays predictable because cloud costs are not exposed to currency fluctuations.

### Simplifying Data Sovereignty Compliance

Many African countries require that certain data be stored within national borders. Meeting these requirements with global cloud providers is complex and expensive.

Local providers keep data in-country but often deliver unreliable service. Simple requests like creating DNS records can take a week. Some providers offer only 98% uptime compared to the industry standard of 99.9%. Manual processes create bottlenecks. Costs are often 2-3x higher than global alternatives.

**Our Solution:**
Strettch Cloud hosts infrastructure in African countries, so your data stays local automatically. You remain compliant with data sovereignty requirements without sacrificing reliability or control. Our infrastructure is automated, designed for high availability, and priced affordably.

### Enabling Multi-Country Operations

Expanding across multiple African countries means navigating different regulations, providers, and compliance requirements in each location.

Operating in 5 African countries typically requires contracting with 5 different local providers, managing 5 separate infrastructures, dealing with 5 different billing systems, and coordinating with 5 local teams. This complexity creates massive overhead and uncertainty.

**Our Solution:**
Strettch Cloud provides a unified platform across African countries. As we expand to new regions, you will be able to deploy infrastructure in multiple countries through a single interface. One platform handles multi-country compliance, billing, and operations.
