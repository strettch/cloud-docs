## Payment Methods and Due Dates 
Strettch Cloud billing cycles are monthly. Your balance accrues over the course of the calendar month based on your resource usage. Your balance is due on the first day of each month.

<Warning>If your team is new, your balance may instead be due when your balance exceeds your usage threshold. Usage thresholds are predetermined spending limits for new or unverified users that, when met, triggers a charge to the team’s primary payment method. We remove usage thresholds automatically once a team has a reliable history of payments.</Warning>

There are two ways to pay for your resource usage:

* At any time during the month, you can **manually make a payment** using any valid payment method.

This lets you pay for your month-to-date resource usage before it’s due, pay an overdue balance, or make a pre-payment. Pre-payments let you pay ahead of time for future resource usage.

* When your balance is due, we first apply any pre-payments, then we automatically charge the primary payment method on your team for the remaining balance.

We currently accept payment using credit cards (Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Discover, UnionPay, Diners Club, and JCB), debit cards, and third-party providers (including PayPal, Google Pay, and Apple Pay). For qualifying customers, we also support direct debit from banks.

## Making a Payment 

You can make a manual payment on the **Billing tab** of the **Settings** page. Your current balance is always listed at the top of the page, next to a top-up button. The text of the button varies if the balance is overdue or if you’re making an early payment.

Click the topu-up button to open a payment modal. In the Payment Amount section, you can select from any past due balance, estimated costs for the current billing period, or a custom amount.

After you enter the amount you want to pay, you can make the payment in two ways:

* **Saved Payment Methods**. You can choose from any credit card, debit card, or third-party provider that you have already saved to the team. You can also add a new credit or debit card with the Add card option in the drop-down menu.

To use this option, select or add a card, then click Submit Payment to pay.

* **Pay with a 3rd-Party Provider**. You can submit a one-time payment with a third-party provider, which in our case is **Irembo Pay**. To use this option, click the top-up button, then complete the transaction after you are rerouted to that provider.

<Note>When using **Irembo Pay**, your balance updates after your payment is processed, which often takes several hours due to processing. It also sometimes holds payments for up to 72 hours, meaning they have received your money but haven’t sent it to us yet, but the payment still applies once they release it.</Note>
