The SC Agent is a lightweight, open-source utility that enables web-based console access to your computes directly from the Strettch Cloud dashboard. It manages the SSH connection between your browser and the compute to provide seamless terminal access without requiring SSH client software.

**Supported Systems:** Ubuntu 20.04+, Debian 8+

## Automatic Installation

The SC Agent installs automatically when you create a new compute instance. No action needed—just wait a few minutes after creation, then access your console from the dashboard.

## Manual Installation

Need to install the agent on an existing instance? Here's how:

### Quick Install (Recommended)

Run this single command to install the agent:

<CodeGroup>
```bash Install the agent
curl -sSL https://repo.cloud.strettch.com/console/install.sh | sudo bash
```
</CodeGroup>

The script will automatically detect your OS, set up repositories, and install the agent:

<CodeGroup>
```bash Check agent status
systemctl status sc-console-agent
```
</CodeGroup>

You should see `Active: active (running)`:

```

```bash Stop the agent
sudo systemctl stop sc-console-agent
```

```bash Restart the agent
sudo systemctl restart sc-console-agent
```

```bash Check status
systemctl status sc-console-agent
```
</CodeGroup>

### Auto-Start on Boot

<CodeGroup>
```bash Enable auto-start
sudo systemctl enable sc-console-agent
```

```bash Disable auto-start
sudo systemctl disable sc-console-agent
```
</CodeGroup>

## Viewing Logs

<CodeGroup>
```bash Live logs
sudo journalctl -u sc-console-agent -f
```

```bash Last hour
sudo journalctl -u sc-console-agent --since=1h
```

```bash Last 100 lines
sudo journalctl -u sc-console-agent -n 100
```
</CodeGroup>

## Updates

The agent updates automatically. You can also trigger updates manually:

<CodeGroup>
```bash Check for and install updates
sudo systemctl start sc-console-agent-updater
```

```bash View update logs
sudo journalctl -u sc-console-agent-updater -f
```
</CodeGroup>

## Uninstalling

To completely remove the agent:

<CodeGroup>
```bash Uninstall the agent
sudo apt-get purge sc-console-agent
```
</CodeGroup>

The uninstall process will stop all services and remove the agent:

```
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree... Done
The following packages will be REMOVED:
  sc-console-agent*
After this operation, 7,449 kB disk space will be freed.
Do you want to continue? [Y/n] Y
...
Removing sc-console-agent (0.1.12) ...

```

**Note:** After uninstalling, console access will be unavailable. You'll need to use SSH with password authentication or SSH keys instead.

## Troubleshooting

### Console Not Working?

1. Verify the agent is running:
   <CodeGroup>
   ```bash
   systemctl status sc-console-agent
   ```
   </CodeGroup>

2. Check recent logs:
   <CodeGroup>
   ```bash
   sudo journalctl -u sc-console-agent -n 50
   ```
   </CodeGroup>

3. Restart the service:
   <CodeGroup>
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart sc-console-agent
   ```
   </CodeGroup>

4. Ensure firewall allows port 22 (SSH - for internal communication) and port 60500 (UDP - for console agent)
