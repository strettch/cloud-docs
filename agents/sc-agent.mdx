The SC Agent is a lightweight, open-source utility that enables web-based console access to your computes directly from the Strettch Cloud web console. It manages the SSH connection between your browser and the compute to provide seamless terminal access without requiring SSH client software.

**Supported Systems:** Ubuntu 20.04+, Debian 8+

## Automatic Installation

The SC Agent installs automatically when you create a new compute instance. No action needed—just wait a few minutes after creation, then access your console from the web console.

## Manual Installation

Need to install the agent on an existing instance? Here's how:

### Quick Install (Recommended)

Run this single command to install the agent:

<CodeGroup>
```bash Install the agent
curl -sSL https://repo.cloud.strettch.com/console/install.sh | sudo bash
```
</CodeGroup>

The script will automatically detect your OS, set up repositories, and install the agent:

### Review Before Installing

Prefer to inspect the script first? Download and review it:

<CodeGroup>
```bash Review the install script
curl -sSL https://repo.cloud.strettch.com/console/install.sh
```
</CodeGroup>

### Verify Installation

Check that the agent is running:

<CodeGroup>
```bash Check agent status
systemctl status sc-console-agent
```
</CodeGroup>

You should see `Active: active (running)`:

```

```

Access your console from the web console within a few minutes.

To check the installed agent version:

<CodeGroup>
```bash Check version
dpkg -l | grep sc-console-agent
```
</CodeGroup>

## Managing the Agent

### Basic Commands

<CodeGroup>
```bash Start the agent
sudo systemctl start sc-console-agent
```

```bash Stop the agent
sudo systemctl stop sc-console-agent
```

```bash Restart the agent
sudo systemctl restart sc-console-agent
```

```bash Check status
systemctl status sc-console-agent
```
</CodeGroup>

### Auto-Start on Boot

<CodeGroup>
```bash Enable auto-start
sudo systemctl enable sc-console-agent
```

```bash Disable auto-start
sudo systemctl disable sc-console-agent
```
</CodeGroup>

## Viewing Logs

<CodeGroup>
```bash Live logs
sudo journalctl -u sc-console-agent -f
```

```bash Last hour
sudo journalctl -u sc-console-agent --since=1h
```

```bash Last 100 lines
sudo journalctl -u sc-console-agent -n 100
```
</CodeGroup>

## Updates

The agent updates automatically. You can also trigger updates manually:

<CodeGroup>
```bash Check for and install updates
sudo systemctl start sc-console-agent-updater
```

```bash View update logs
sudo journalctl -u sc-console-agent-updater -f
```
</CodeGroup>

## Uninstalling

To completely remove the agent:

<CodeGroup>
```bash Uninstall the agent
sudo apt-get purge sc-console-agent
```
</CodeGroup>

The uninstall process will stop all services and remove the agent:

```
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree... Done
The following packages will be REMOVED:
  sc-console-agent*
After this operation, 7,449 kB disk space will be freed.
Do you want to continue? [Y/n] Y
...
Removing sc-console-agent (0.1.12) ...
Removing SC-Agent (keeping configuration)...
Stopping sc-console-agent-update-scheduler.timer...

Disabling sc-console-agent.service...
SC-Agent removed (configuration preserved in /etc/sc-console-agent)
Purging configuration files for sc-console-agent (0.1.12) ...
```

**Note:** After uninstalling, console access will be unavailable. You'll need to use SSH with password authentication or SSH keys instead.

## Troubleshooting

### Console Not Accessible?

If you can't access your compute console from the Strettch Cloud web console, follow these steps:

#### Step 1: SSH into Your Virtual Machine

First, connect to your VM using SSH:

<CodeGroup>
```bash SSH into your VM
ssh -p 222 root@your-vm-ip-address
```
</CodeGroup>

Enter your password when prompted. Once logged in, proceed with the following steps.

#### Step 2: Verify Required Ports are Open

The console requires two ports to function:

<CodeGroup>
```bash Check if ports are listening
sudo netstat -tuln | grep -E ':(22|60124)'
```
</CodeGroup>

**Expected:** You should see port 22 (TCP) and port 60124 (UDP) listed as `LISTEN`

If ports are blocked by your firewall, allow them:
<CodeGroup>
```bash UFW firewall
sudo ufw allow 22/tcp
sudo ufw allow 60124/udp
```

```bash iptables firewall
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p udp --dport 60124 -j ACCEPT
```
</CodeGroup>

#### Step 3: Check if the Agent is Running

<CodeGroup>
```bash Check agent status
systemctl status sc-console-agent
```
</CodeGroup>

**Look for:** `Active: active (running)` in the output

#### Step 4: Take Action Based on Status

**If the agent is not installed** (you see `could not be found`):
- Go to the [Manual Installation](#manual-installation) section above and install the agent

**If the agent is stopped** (you see `inactive (dead)` or `failed`):
<CodeGroup>
```bash Restart the agent
sudo systemctl restart sc-console-agent
```

```bash Enable auto-start on boot
sudo systemctl enable sc-console-agent
```
</CodeGroup>

#### Step 5: Test Console Access

Wait 30-60 seconds, then try accessing your console from the web console.

## Security

The agent uses encrypted communication, cryptographic signatures, and port knocking for secure access. It runs with minimal privileges and updates automatically for security patches.
